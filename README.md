This repo is for documenting my journey on building things with Rust.\
I come from front-end application development background, and now I am chasing my curiosity in building things using a low level programming language.\
Heard great things about Rust, with the versatility to do various things with it.\
But i am more interested in building Games/Simulation to test AI agents, playing around with Physics engine, maybe even build one or extend one which is open source.\
The intent is to build a better simulation software for robots to play around, learn and get intelligient.\

As of now, its very open ended quest which is just fueled by my own curiosity to learn and build, hence the name "building-with-rust".\
The updates are in the updates folder, and it will reflect on my personal website https://souravk.com/projects/building-with-rust.\

Once there is a moment of enlightenment or convergence of some theories and discoveries, the updates will move out of this repo into a separate project with it's own name. And the updates will continue to reflect on https://souravk.com/projects/<project-name>.\
