I looked into bunch of video into procedural generation, shaders and ray marching in game development.\
I am still figuring out what should be the right approach to take, to build the simulation engine for robots.\
Some early thoughts are to test games, where the character is attached with LLM ai agent and navigate to win it with the help of VLMs.\
